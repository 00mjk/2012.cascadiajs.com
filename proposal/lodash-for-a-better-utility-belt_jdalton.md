Lo-Dash is a drop-in replacement for Underscore.js, delivering performance, bug fixes, and additional features.
I will discuss the unconventional way in which Lo-Dash gets its performance boost, dive into its features, and
explore some of the extra geeky JS things I learned or implemented while developing Lo-Dash.
